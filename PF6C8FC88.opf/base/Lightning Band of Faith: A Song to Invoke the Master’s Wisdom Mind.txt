The Lightning Band of Faith

A Song to Invoke the Master’s Wisdom Mind

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Aho!In the blessed place, the glorious mountain of Cāmara,You, precious Guru, father who embodies
all Three Roots,Are surrounded by a vast retinue of vidyādharas and siddhas.I, your
devoted son, call out to you in prayer.

This modern world is like a city of cannibal demons.[1]Every day reveals the nature of impermanence.While
everybody acts as if confused as to what is right and wrong,And disdains the
teachings of the precious Sage.Assailed by the uncivilized, barbaric forces of darkness,All
dharma practitioners have had their lives destroyed.The welfare of the teachings and beings
has been plundered,All the sublime supports of splendour and merit have been ruined.And
pernicious demons and spirits have taken charge,As a result of which, we’re beset by all
manner of difficulties.

In times such as these, Orgyen, may you watch over us!As we call out to you, Lord Padmākara,
in heartfelt prayer,Unleash the full force of your mighty strength and compassion.Dispel
all adverse circumstances, we pray!

Padmasambhava, sole sufficient refuge of this vast landOf Tibet, surrounded by snowy peaks,
care for us!We have no other source of hope but you, O lord,Inspire us with your blessings,
here and now!

Written on the 25th day of the black (i.e., third) month of the Fire Dog year.
