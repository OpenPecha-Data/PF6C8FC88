In This Pure Awareness

by Khenpo Shenga

In this pure awareness without basis or origin,How tiresome it seems to practise dos and don'ts!


In this present awareness in which whatever arises is freed by itself,How tedious it seems to
cling to notions of defilement and antidote!

In this spontaneous, naturally present meditation,How exhausting it seems to cultivate mental
fixation!

In this state of great bliss that is primordial and innate,How misguided it seems to rely upon
a physical consort!

In this natural, spontaneous perfection of the three doors,How distracting it seems to contemplate
artificial maṇḍalas!

I spoke these verses to myself.
