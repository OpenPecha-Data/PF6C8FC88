A Lamenting Plea for Compassion

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Aho.Treasury of wisdom, love and power:Lerab Lingpa, care for me.Look upon me from the luminous
expanse,And grant your blessings for evermore.

In the palace on Cāmara’s mountain of glory,In the ranks of the Mahāguru himself,Together with
an assembly of ḍākinīs—How delightful it must be to revel so!

But has the special emissary whom Padma appointedTo protect the Tibetan peopleReally forsaken
his Tibetan subjectsAnd travelled to this realm of Lotus Light?

Can we withstand this,Forsaken by your compassion,When plagued perpetuallyBy the ills of this
evil age?For you to pass now into peaceIs surely a breakage of your pledge.

Will the decline of your treasures,So profound and so extensive,Bring vast benefit to beingsNow
and in the future?

As a promoter of Padma’s sublime teaching,You were without rival, like a great treasure.Only
father of mine, jewel upon my crown,Hear now this lamentation of mine.Arise in the form of
a supreme emanation,Who is both learned and accomplished,And spread your destined treasure
teachingsThroughout the threefold world.

Having quenched the flames of Tibet’s malevolenceAnd brought happiness to rival the moon in
splendour,May you spread the Buddhist teachings in generalAnd especially those of the Ancient
Translations.

May your fourfold activity always be unobstructed,And may you lead to liberation all with whom
you are connected.Through your bestowal of the supreme accomplishment,May all be auspicious
for your emanations in the three times.And may this auspiciousness continue long into
the future.

Thus, Jamyang Lodrö Gyatso made this prayer spontaneously with a mind of unshakeable devotion.
