A Song Requested by the Buddhist Monk Jamyang Yönten Gyatso
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

om swasti
Oṃ svasti.
kyabné kündü lama dorjé chang
Guru Vajradhara, the embodiment of all sources of refuge,
kadrin nyammé chökyi lodrö khyen
Chökyi Lodrö, incomparable in your kindness, care for me!
dak gyü chö dang drepar jingyi lob
Inspire me to fuse my mindstream with the Dharma!1
saltong zungjuk trödral tawa tong
Help me to realize the view of the union of clarity and emptiness, beyond conceptual elaboration,
yengmé dzinmé gompa lam du khyer
To integrate it through the meditation that is undistracted and without fixation,
dompa sum gyi künchö nampar dak
To maintain utterly pure conduct by means of the three sets of vows,
wang shyi drebu tsé dir minpar shok
And to reap the fruits of the four empowerments within this very lifetime!
dorna kyiduk lek nyen chi jung yang
In short, whatever befalls me, whether happiness or sorrow, circumstances good or bad,2
resa shyen namé do lama khyen
I have no other hope but you – O guru, care for me!
changchub bardu dralmé tukjé zung
Until I reach awakening, hold me with your compassion without ever parting.

Written by the Khyentse tulku Chökyi Lodrö at the behest of Jamyang Yönten Gyatso, a bhikṣu
follower of Śākyamuni. May virtue and excellence abound.
