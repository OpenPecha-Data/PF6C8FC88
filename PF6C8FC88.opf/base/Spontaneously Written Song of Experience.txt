Spontaneously Written Song of Experience

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Aho!The Great Perfection of primordial freedom,Which all sentient beings possess,Does not need
to be sought elsewhere.The original state of things, primordial purity,The way in which
the natural condition abides—To recognise this alone is sufficient.Mentally created contrivance
is pointless.Untainted by the phenomena of intellectual speculation,Clinging to notions
of alertness, relaxation and the like,No matter whether the mind is active or at rest,It
is none other than rigpa's creative expression.Saṃsāra does not make it worse;Nirvāṇa
does not make it better.

Within the vast, all-pervasive realm of reality (dharmadhātu),In the expanse of the single,
all-encompassing sphere,All thoughts involving the duality of perceiver and perceivedAre equal,
without any basis for distinction or exclusion.

When this is realized through the guru's kindness,There and then, in that very moment,There
is freedom.

This is the special feature of Ati Dzogpachenpo,The secret pith instruction on clear light.There
is no swifter, profounder path than thisIn any of the sūtras or tantras.To encounter
it puts the mind at ease.

So that the child may follow the father's lead,
Omniscient guru, grant your blessings!

This was written spontaneously.
