Five-Verse Doha of Yogic Realization

by Mipham Rinpoche

Namo mañjuśriye!

Having imbibed the nectar of the guru’s advice,And followed the lineage’s way of profound instructions,I
have arrived at the genuine state of realization,The sovereign mind-as-such,
uncontrived and naturally at rest.

Mind is equal to space, clear and unsullied,Naturally free from the turbulence of thought,Innate
dharmakāya, co-emergent great bliss—Actual suchness wherein all things are equal.

This space has never known happiness or suffering.And awareness, too, has always been free of
arising,Without the marks of joy or sorrow, transition or change.This is the supreme yoga—seeing
the clear light of one’s own awareness.

Within the experience of space all phenomena are vividly apparent.Within the experience of awareness
saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear as illusory.Whatever manifests is freed by itself without
gain or loss, adoption or rejection.Multiplicity is of a single nature within this blissful
yoga of space.

May great compassion, which is truly without the slightest notionOf reference or focus, extend
to the farthest limits of space and time.And through effortless, spontaneous enlightened
activityMay I liberate the entire ocean of infinite living beings!

Dhīḥ wrote down whatever arose spontaneously on the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the
Earth Bird year of the fifteenth calendrical cycle (1909). May virtue abound!
