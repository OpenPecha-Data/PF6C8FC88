The Blissful Path to Awakening

A Song on the Essence of Definitive Meaning

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Father, authentic guru Vajradhara,With a mind of intense and ardent faith, I pray to you.Foremost
one, through your compassion and power,Inspire me to realize the secret of the definitive
meaning.

These apparent phenomena are my own mind.As in the deluded perceptions of a vivid dream,They
lack basis or origin and are but empty forms.While they appear they are by nature empty;While
they are empty, their appearance is unobstructed.On a relative level, causes and effects
are unfailing.Ultimately, the emptiness of freedom from arising, remaining and ceasingIs
indivisible from dependent origination—they are of a single taste,And this ground beyond
limiting extremes is the Great Middle Way.

That which does not exist externally is one's own mind.The genuine nature of one's mindIs the
wisdom of the fourth part beyond the three.[1]Unspoilt by thoughts involving dualistic graspingSettle
naturally into the fresh, unaltered groundAnd while continuously mindful remain
free of distraction and fixation.Meditation on clear light unfettered by the intellectAnd
in a state that is beyond hopes and fears,Free from the exertions of activity and actor,Is
the path, the cultivation of the Great Seal (Mahāmudrā).

Within the wisdom of the ground that is pure from the beginning,The great empty dharmadhātuWhich
is free from all dimensions and extremes,The three kāyas are spontaneously present, unsought
yet perfect.By applying the key points of gateways, objects, winds and awareness,The
lamps of the visionary path blaze ever stronger.Beginning with the vision of direct realization,Until
ultimately reaching the dissolution of phenomena beyond the mind.The corruptions
of the outer and inner elements come to an endAnd awareness matures into a body of light.Then
activity for others' welfare continues without interruption.This is the fruition,
Great Perfection.

Through this instruction in the form of song,May each and every sentient being of the three
realmsRealize the indivisibility of these Three GreatsAnd saṃsāra be emptied from its very
depths.

Thus, Chökyi Lodrö wrote this in the multistoried Palace Monastery at Gangtok, Sikkim, in response
to a request, accompanied by gifts of silk and silver, from his own student Gelong
Rinchen. May virtue abound!
