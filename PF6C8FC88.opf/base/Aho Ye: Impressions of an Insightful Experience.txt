Aho Ye: When Looking at These Outer Appearances…etc.

by Lachung Apo

Aho ye!When looking at these outer appearances,They appear as they do and seem so real.When
looking at the essence of the mind within,It is empty, and yet while empty it appears.This
awareness, which clings to duality in what appears and is imputed,Is itself deluded and interacts
with delusory appearances.The tongue of rational argument, which clings to reality
and delusion,Is severed by the Great Perfection.The child of mindfulness and awareness mounts
the spyglassAt the summit where liberation and delusion meet,And, in the fresh experience
of not discovering anything tangible,Sees the Great Perfection.In the playground of
the children of the eight consciousnesses,Lies the old man with the confidence of familiarity
and experience,Basking in the sun of continuous luminosity —Perfectly at ease, spacious
and relaxed: a la la!

On the evening of the 25th of the ninth month of the Earth Monkey year (1968), while intoxicated
by alcohol, this spontaneously slipped from my mouth.
