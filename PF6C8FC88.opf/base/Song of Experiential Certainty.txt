Song of Experiential Certainty

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Aho! In the vast city of existenceThe child of mind became drunk on delusion.After wandering
along many winding pathsIt arrived at the plains of great bliss.For it is there that the
heroic king of awareness resides.He bestows the jewel of dharmakāya liberation in the ground,Which
is not separate from him even though it appears so.This is not to be found externally
but dwells within oneself.In the past the veil of unknowing kept me in confusion.But
now the sun of naturally occurring awareness has risen;The knots of the eight consciousnesses
have been undone.There is no searching as to where they have gone,Since the state of primordial
freedom has been reached.Any thought of wishing to meditate is now cast aside.This
awareness extends throughout boundless space.Appearances settle as they are, free and unrestrained.Appearances
and mind merge as one in non-duality.There's no necessity for mindfulness
to stand guard.All cognitive veils, such as talk of fixating and relaxing,Have simply
faded away within basic space.And the dharmakāya that is and always has been purePervades
the whole of appearance and existence.This pervasion is instantaneous, total within the
vast expanse,Perfect within the great, all-encompassing sphere of clear light.The presence
of the three buddha-bodies is stark,Beyond deliberate focus or notions of concreteness,Free
from the extremes of singularity and multiplicity,Perfect within the great inner space
of the three kāyas.This is seen with the eyes of insightful knowledge,In which knowing is
not separate from what is known.

In the state that is indwelling yet not dull—Hūṃ!In great self-luminous, primordial wisdom—Āḥ!In
great self-manifest, outward radiance—Oṃ!

This song that is an expression of realization,Empty sound played upon the instrument of the
throat,Is offered by the crazy child Yeshe DorjeAs a gift to delight the guru of his own
awareness.

Through the virtue of this may saṃsāra be emptied from its very depths!

On the seventh day of the tenth month of the Water Snake year.
