Drawing Out the Quintessence of the View

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

In devotion, I bow before the guru of my own mind,Who reveals the meaning of the indivisibility
of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.Although the full range of explanations is extensive,The essence
of the private instruction for disciples,[1]Boiled down to its key points, is as follows:This
very mind which serves as the basisFor the proliferation of various thoughts and perceptions,When
it is left as it is, unaltered,Is the indivisible union of clarity and emptiness,Lucid,
clear, without thought and inexpressible.Understand how upon this innate awareness,Which
is indefinable and without basis of designation,The indivisibility of saṃsāra and
nirvāṇa is complete.Sustain, without distraction or grasping, this radiant clarity,Which
is and always has been perfectly pure.This is the fundamental core of the ultimate practice.It
maintains the vital force of the four empowerments.And it brings accomplishment within
this very lifetime.

Written in Darjeeling on the twenty-fifth day of Saga Dawa during the Earth Dog year.[2]
