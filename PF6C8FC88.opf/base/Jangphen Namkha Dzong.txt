Jangphen Namkha Dzong

by Milarepa

Then, the benefactors from Drothang received an audience with the venerable [Milarepa] and asked
him “What special qualities does this sacred place have?” As a response he sang the following
song:

O lord guru, it is you I supplicate!Do you know the qualities of this place?If you know not
the qualities of this place,This is the isolated place Jangphen Namkha Dzong.In the palace
that is Jangphen Namkha DzongWarm southern clouds gather above,While blue rivers flow down
below.Behind are red rocks and the expanse of sky,And in front, flowers dazzle on meadows.Wild
beasts roar and growl on all sides,And vultures, kings among birds, fly about.Light
rain gently falls from the sky.The bees continuously hum their songs,Jennies and foals dance
and play, frolicking about.Monkeys big and small practice acrobatics.The mother larks
and their young abound with melodious song.Cool streams of mineral water speak pleasantries.The
languages of the seasons are aids to meditative experience!The inconceivable qualities
of this sacred placeI have sung in the form of a joyful song,I have spoken of them as an
oral instruction.Ladies and gentlemen, benefactors gathered here,Follow after me and do
as I have done—Forsake negative deeds and accomplish virtue!

From the Songs of Milarepa.
