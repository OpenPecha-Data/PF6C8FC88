A Song for Travelling from Sikkim to Tibet

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

The vision of the intermediate turning is intrinsic emptiness,[1]The approach and writings of
the glorious protector Ārya Nāgārjuna.

The final turning concerns the essence[2] discourse of definitive meaning,Drawn out primarily
by the venerable Ārya Asaṅga.

The intentions of both Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga come down to the same point.The three of the Sakya,
Kagyü and Nyingma are in agreement.The sugata-essence is not a mere vacuity,For the kāyas
and wisdoms, qualities and activitiesAre spontaneously present, unsought, as the awareness
element, basic space.The mind of purity, attainment and freedom is the Buddha—Stabilize
your certainty concerning this crucial point.

Since it possesses the powers and the rest it overcomes emotional and cognitive veils,So that
you may become one who has brought saṃsāra to an end.

If you wish to practice the transcendent perfection of wisdom in a single sitting,Bringing everything
together on the basis of the generation of bodhicitta alone,All is included within
the practice of indivisible emptiness and compassion—Relative bodhicitta, the conventional
elements of the application of all aspects,[3]And ultimate bodhicitta, which includes
all that is featureless.This, which is profound in meaning, is my instruction is to you.

Chökyi Lodrö wrote this for his own student Traltso Rinchen,[4] who requested a song when he
was travelling from Sikkim to Tibet.
