Song of the Enchanting Wildwoods

by Longchen Rabjam

In Sanskrit: sāna-ānantavāti
In Tibetan: nags tshal kun tu dga’ ba’i gtam

I prostrate to my guru and the Three Jewels!

Her form, a peaceful grove of fresh blossoms,Pleasingly dappled with the soothing moonlight
of compassion —The sole restful tonic for those long exhausted —I honor the miraculous wildwoods,Which
I see now as if for the first time.

Since I am broken-hearted here in the city of existence,My mind sends these tidings its own
way —A story about resorting to the peaceful forestFor someone who will apply their heart
to the Dharma path.

I see the truth that this life won’t last and is swiftly heading toward ruin,That even this
body which I’ve so lavishly cared for will be lost,And I’ll have to head off alone to parts
unknown.So now, I’m off to the wildwoods.

When I get distracted, I lose sight of the path to freedom —Which is solely responsible for
prolonging my saṃsāric suffering.Now that I’ve seen the plague of conceptual thinking,I’m
off to live in the unborn peace of the wildwoods.

The busy cities are bonfires of desire.I see now that if I catch the terrible plague of existence,I’ll
just keep wandering in the canyons of saṃsāra.So, I’m off right now to the wildwoods.

Every being in existence is threatened by afflictionAnd totally bound by terrifying chains of
duality.Because each one has at some point or another been my mother or father,To free them,
I must go to the wildwoods.

All these outer things we keep looking toAre impermanent and completely unreliable —Seeing how
they change like autumn clouds,My heart knows I must go to the peaceful wildwoods.

The sun of the good times of yore has setAnd the moon of mean people is on the rise;The darkness
of evildoing māras closes in on all sides.I see it, so I must go to the wildwoods right
now.

People are so difficult to be with —The good ones won’t lead the way, and the bad ones never
stop.At the slightest provocation, their mood can shift unpredictably.No matter what I do,
they’re never satisfied.So, I can’t stay here — I’m going to the wildwoods.

If I don’t take charge of my own mind,No one else is going to steer the course for me.If I’m
really going to give the best counsel to my own mind, it’s this:Don’t stay here — you must
go to the wildwoods.

Spending time with the spiritually immature diminishes my virtueAnd certainly makes me more
negative.To make sure I’m totally engaged in the positive,From today on, I must go to the
wildwoods.

These days, when you spend time with somebody,You might make a quick friend,But at a moment’s
notice,They can become as unbearable as an enemy.Therefore, I can’t stay — I’m going to
the wildwoods.

Alas, even the light of the Sage’s teachingsIs drawing down upon the peaks of the western mountains.Once
it has set, the lion’s roar of the true DharmaWill not be heard again.So, I’m
off to the wildwoods.

When explained well, nobody pays attention.Poor explanations contradict the true Dharma.Since
beings prefer to believe that the buddhas have taught onlyThat they should do what they
like, and nothing else,When I teach the real Dharma way, everyone reviles me like an enemy.For
whatever reason, when they teach non-Dharma these days,People love it, even though it
sends them off to the lower realms.I simply can’t understand what they’re up to.Seeing all
this, since I aim to accomplish the benefit of beings,I can’t stay. I won’t stay. I’m going
to the wildwoods.

Even though your body is beautiful with discipline,You soar on the wings of the three trainings,And
you’ve plunged into the lotus lake of study and contemplation,If you aren’t also wealthy,
everyone just reviles and ignores you.The evil-acting irreligious rich are treated
like gods.This is an age when fools are marketed better than the holy ones.Seeing these signs
of the times, I’m off to the wildwoods.

Wherever I look,Apart from people putting their energy into the material world,Those practicing
the Dharma path are as rare as a supernova.[1]Having seen this to be true,If I’m going
to accomplish the true Dharma,I can’t stay any longer — I’m going to the wildwoods.

Compared to those who seek distraction with every thought,People who care for themselves according
to the Dharma are altogether rare.Those who actually practice it are bullied and disregarded.Thus,
I can’t stay — I’m going to the wildwoods.

Even if you spend this life in introspection,It passes so quickly, without pausing day or night.Having
seen that laziness always gets the better of my virtueAnd that this mind won’t
settle even a little,I’m off to the wildwoods right now.

Because I’m distracted by the eight worldly concernsSuch as preferring praise to blame,Even
though I live spiritually, its all for this one life.So, I can’t stay — I’m going to the wildwoods.

All the good times I had until yesterdayAre now as real as last night’s dream,Though sometimes
they do become objects of pleasant nostalgia.Seeing how meaningless this is, I’m going
to the wildwoods.

Even savoring my desires, I never feel content.All the pleasures that I’ve experiencedFrom birth
till nowWould not satisfy me, even if they returned.This mind is addicted to desire.If
I’m not even securing this life’s happiness in this way,How will I ever achieve the nirvāṇa
I seekWhich ensures benefit that lasts through all lives?So, I’m done following the desire
highway.O dear heart, we can do it:Let’s abandon these desires and get to the wildwoods.

Since all this thinking hasn’t done me much good,In order to grow accustomed to observing my
own mind,I’m going today to the wildwoods,Where you, dear mind, will realize lasting happiness.

Once I’m lying on my deathbed,I’ll have to leave everything behind and travel on — alone.This
time is certain to arrive before long.So, right now, I’m going to the wildwoods.

Because this time is incredibly degenerate,Even if someone like me were to teach,It won’t really
benefit others.Because I aspire to be of benefit to future ages,I can’t stay here — I’m
going to meditate in the wildwoods.

O mind, dismiss these preoccupationsThat are of no help to yourself, and no help to others.You
must, from today forth,Go to the wildwoods to meditate on the nature of mindIn order to
accomplish what will definitely bring us benefit.

But absolutely, I make the noble heartfelt aspirationThat a time may come when I receiveThe
opportunity to be of benefit to others,Accomplishing their needs on a vast scaleWithout thinking
of myself for even a moment.Now though, if I have one thought in my heart,It’s this:
don’t wait — go meditate in the wildwoods right now.

In order to encourage those below me to listenAnd especially uphold the buddhadharma,My primary
concern will be the exchange of the essential teachings.This will spread the Sage’s doctrineAnd
increase the intelligence of my own mind.

Whatever I conceive of is impermanent and meaningless.Even the best conditioned things are bound
to fall apart.Having seen this to be true,I will seek the sacred undeceptive mind —The
essential and indestructible truth.

All the Dharma collections that the Sage has taught,Come down to giving up desiresAnd settling
evenly[2] in the peaceful truth — nothing else.O mind, consider your mortality,And be intent
to go to the wildwoods.

The wildwoods have been universally praised by the victors.So, they encourage anyone who has
few desires and is rich in contentmentTo go live in the wildwoods.

Now when there’s all this unstable thinking,The primary task is to settle mind inwardly.For
it projects itself toward objects in the midst of many distractions,Unable to rest for even
a moment.Even if well-guarded, it follows compulsively after emotions.Therefore, I can’t
stay here. I’m going to meditate in the wildwoods.

Intellectually understanding phenomena’s natureAnd leaving them as mere objects of mindfulness
is no help.So, if I’m going to become intimate with the true nature of phenomena,I can’t
wait — I must go to the wildwoods.

The wilds naturally entail few distractions and obligationsAnd are free from the suffering of
anxiety and adversity.So today, be happy go to the peaceful wildwoodsWhich far surpass the
joys of the cities of the higher realms.

Well, my dear mind, listen now to the charms of the wildwoods:

Precious trees fit to offer to the victors,Abound there, branches laden with fruit —Their leaves
and flowers fragrant and blossoming,Graced with the scent of incense and mist on the
breeze.

Cascades of water descend with the gentle rumble of bass drums.The hills above are bathed in
the coolness of the moonAnd covered with a thick robe of clouds,Above which shine the stars
and constellations in their perfect beauty.

Flocks of geese glide above fresh smelling ponds andBirds and deer roam freely about.Bees buzz
melodiously everywhere among theLotus and utpala flowers, among the wish-fulfilling trees.

The trees sway, dancing back and forth, back and forth,And the tips of their branches bow,As
if lovingly welcoming guests,Saying, “We’re glad you’ve come!”

The cool, pure ponds are covered with lotus flowersWhose faces are bright as if smiling upon
us.Surrounding are groves of flowers and treesAnd grassy meadows holding the robes of the
sky.All of this shining like the stars on a clear nightOr gods playing in pleasure groves.

While the cuckoo sings his intoxicating, piercing song,And the flowers sway in the cool seasonal
breeze,Cloud-elephants trumpet their joyAnd the appearance of rain heralds cooling goodness.


In all four seasons,Guiltless subsistence can be hadFrom readily available fruit, leaves, and
roots.

In the woods, the afflictions naturally subsideFor there is no one to say unpleasant things.Having
gone far from busy cities,In the woods, peaceful meditation naturally grows.In the
woods, the mind is tamed as it conforms to the true Dharma,And one can find the bliss of inner
peace.

In short, the charms of the wildwoods are endless —Even if I had eons, I could not conclusively
extol them.

The attainment of awakening by all the victors of the three timesOnly occurs when staying in
the wildwoods —Never in stressful cities and countries.

Offering flowers and incense to all the buddhasFor eons as numerous as the grains of sand in
the GangesWould bring but a fraction of the merit gainedFrom taking seven steps in the direction
of retreat,With the qualities of the wildwoods in one’s mind.I encourage you thus
to contemplate the qualities of the woodsAs detailed in the Moon Lamp Sūtra.[3]

Once you’ve gone there, you’ll live near caves and cliffs,In areas rich with medicinal herbs,
amidst flowers and trees,Or in a simple thatched hut made of grass and leaves.You’ll sustain
yourself with the bare necessitiesSuch as water, kindling, and fruitAnd have the space
to apply yourself day and night to what is wholesome.

There, inspired by the turning of the leaves,You’ll realize with certainty thatBeauty, health,
and various abilitiesAll gradually change—that they lack solidity:What is called “the diminishing
of one’s assets.”

There, inspired by the falling of the leaves,You’ll realize with certainty thatFriends, strangers,
and even your own bodyAre such that they separate,Even if they are together now, for
the moment:What is called “the reality of loss.”

There, inspired by the pond losing its lotus flowers,You’ll realize with certainty thatAll wealth,
assets, and sensual objectsAre in the end changeable, lacking solidity:What is called
“the exhaustion of what is amassed.”

There, inspired by the passing of the months and seasons,You’ll realize with certainty thatEven
this body, like the blooming flowers of late spring,Changes with time, its youth passing:What
is called “the arrival of the Lord of Death.”

There, inspired by the ripening and falling of fruitYou’ll realize with certainty thatYouth,
the prime of life, and old age are just so,That there’s no certainty of when death will occur:What
is called “what is born is bound to die.”

There, inspired by reflections appearing in ponds,You’ll realize with certainty thatAs the diverse
range of phenomena appear,They lack inherent nature,Just like illusions, mirages,Or
reflections of the moon in water:What is called “empty of true existence.”

Having thus internalized the nature of all that is,Sit upright on a comfortable seat, with the
body at ease,And cultivate bodhicitta, concerned with the needs of beings.

Don’t dwell on the past or fantasize about the future,Don’t engineer this natural ongoing presence.Don’t
direct the mind, or draw it within,Just let it settle without distraction,Resting
without grasping or conceptually structuring this open clarityThat is vivid, quiet, lucid,
illuminating.This is the wisdom intent of the buddhas of the three times.

Other than settling, easily relaxedIn the innate experience of the way your mind abides —There’s
nothing you need to contemplate.So, you can release the effort it takes to engineer it,For
it is not an object of conceptual elaboration —It can’t be conceived of or investigated.Yet,
it is the wisdom intent of all the buddhas.

Therefore, to quiet the tangled mess of thought,All you need to do is look into the intimately
peaceful nature of mind.

At the end of the session, dedicate without reifying the three spheres.

In between sessions,Cultivate your appreciation of impermanence and death.Conditioned things
have no attainable essence and are rife with problems.Consider how saṃsāra’s nature is also
like this.Once you have realized how the play of all external appearanceAre like dream
or illusion,Let everything be within the equality of the experiential dimension of space.

Don’t affirm or reject anything.Give up attempting to engineer experience.By living in this
fashion, anything that happensWill help reveal the unborn and unceasing nature of mind,Your
innate nature, just as it is.

Also at night, when it is time to sleep,Release your mind into a conceptually unstructured experienceWithin
the reality of its unborn nature.

When you wake and appearances dawn,Repeatedly relate to them as being ineffable by nature like
illusions.

Once you have seen this precious treasury of your mind’s natureTo be such that nothing need
be added or removed,You will cross the painful ocean of existenceTo the simple experience
of that which is eternally peacefulAnd entails no suffering,Arriving at the boundless state
of buddhahood.

In the meantime, consider the magical play of concepts that occurAs the natural arising of your
essence, to which you need not grasp.Thoughts arise as the display of dharmakāya’s essence.

When appearances occur as you are up and about,Think, “I will guide these beings.May I be their
protector, refuge, and friend.”Once you have entrusted your mind to bodhicitta,Bear in
mind that your conduct should ideally be pure.You needn’t think about anything other than
the needs of beings.This is the miraculous tree of compassion,Which nourishes the shoots
of the omniscient victors.

This path surpasses the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.For it is a great lake of innumerable qualities
from whichThe light of immeasurable compassion spreads —The incredible source of
the precious state of perfect buddhahood.

Nothing could be more incredible than this.Thus, anyone who is wiseShould definitely go meditate
in the wildwoodsTo accomplish sublime and peaceful awakening.

If in this way I do not accomplish the Dharma now,Later, who knows what direction I’ll head
inAnd how difficult it will be to reconnect with the path at that point.Then, there will be
nothing I can do.So now, while I have the chance, I must apply myself to the Dharma.

Nobody knows for sure whether they will die today or tomorrow.Nothing is totally reliable,The
Lord of Death is drawing ever nearer —And I have no power to send him back.So, quickly,
quickly, I’m off to meditate in the wildwoods.

When death comes,None of our wealth, friends, or relativesWill be of any help to us.A real practitioner
will have nothing to fear of death.So, let death come quickly here — I’m going
to the wildwoods.

It won’t be long before everyone, everything, and I will all be gone.This is certain to come
to pass.So I can accomplish a bit of the Dharma now,I’m definitely going to live in the wildwoods.

Those who live an ethically impeccable life withAbundant study,Good meditation,Life in the wildwoods,And
training in what is virtuousShall fearlessly discover great joy in the face of
death.

The cause of their joy is exactly life in the wilds.Thus, I am leaving to meditate there.Nobody
could know for certainIf the time when I shall be no more will come tomorrow or not.On
the morning of my death,Nothing will protect me other than the Dharma.For the Dharma is my
protector, my home, and my friend.It points me to the fine manor of the higher realms.

Thus, mind, remember that death is coming!I must go to live in the wildwoods for the love of
Dharma.

My mind sent this letter to itself.Mind, if you’re listening, you are fortunate in the Dharma.This
message, spoken for your benefit, came straight from the heart.Mind, take it, and head
to the wildwoods.

This song of the enchanting wildwoodsWas penned by the man from SamyéWhose mind was turned to
liberation by renunciation,On the highest mountain peak of Being at Ease in the Nature of
Mind,So he would wholeheartedly head to the wildwoods.

Through any virtue arisen from this,May all beings extract their minds from the city of saṃsāraAnd
find freedom all togetherIn the enchanting wildwoods of omniscient liberation.

This Song of the Enchanting Wildwoods was written by Ngagi Wangpo (Longchen Rabjam), the well-educated
poet from glorious Samyé Monastery, on the highest peak of the mountain when renunciation
surged in him for our saṃsāric home.
