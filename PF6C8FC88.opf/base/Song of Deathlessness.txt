Song of Deathlessness[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ahoyé!

Let all thoughts of the demon of death
Dissolve within the space of deathlessness.

Let my own deathless awareness
Be perfected as the deathless kāya.

What we call ‘death’ is but a name.

Let Yama, Lord of Death,
Encounter death-conquering longevity.[2]

Let the hosts of deathless vidyādharas
Grant the attainment of deathlessness.

By Chökyi Lodrö.

The original Tibetan text is untitled; this title has been added by the translator.  ↩The translation
of this line is tentative. If correct, he original Tibetan could refer to the cliff
of death-conquering longevity (tshe zhal brag), where Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa revealed
a terma related to longevity.  ↩
