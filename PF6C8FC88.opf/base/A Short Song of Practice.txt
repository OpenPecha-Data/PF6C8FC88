A Short Song of Practice

by Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol

Namo Guru Mañjughoṣaya!

Dharmakāya Samantabhadra, sambhogakāya Vajradhara,Supreme nirmāṇakāya, Lord of Sages, and the
rest—Along with those who turn the Dharma-wheel for all,My teachers, direct and indirect—before
you all, I prostrate.

Although I have nothing new to say, which hasn’t been said beforeBy the victorious buddhas and
their spiritual offspring,The learned and accomplished masters of India and Tibet,I shall
sing a little on what they have taught, so listen well!

Leisure and fortune are hard to find,[1] and death strikes quickly,[2]Actions and their effects
do not deceive,[3] and there’s no happiness in saṃsāra.[4]

I take refuge in the Three Jewels, the sources of protection,[5]And generate love, compassion,
and the mind of bodhicitta.[6]

Nectar cascades from Vajrasattva, seated upon my crown,To purify my illnesses, demons, harmful
influences, and obscurations.[7]

I offer my body, my estate, and whatever virtues I have amassed to the deities:Kindly accept
them and bestow your blessings and accomplishment.[8]

Root Guru, who is the embodiment of all sources of refuge,I supplicate you: bless me, I pray![9]


Imagine and continually recall the Buddha,Appearing very clearly in the space in front of you.[10]

The nature of mind is like space, primordially empty;Rest in this empty cognizance without the
slightest grasping.[11]

All that appears within the sky of mind is like a rainbow;Understand the unity of appearance
and emptiness to be illusory.[12]

Meditate upon your physical body as the form of the deity—appearing yet empty;And your speech
as the mantra to be recited—audible yet empty.[13]

Clearly visualize A and HAṂ within the three channels and the chakras,And increase the blissful
warmth by holding the vase-breath.[14]

From time to time, be diligent in purifying the different realms,

To conclude, seal your practice with prayers of dedication and aspiration.

If you are able to give up life’s distraction and practice in isolationThe leisure and fortune
you have won will be made truly meaningful.

May this merit cause all my fortunate disciples
To practise the Dharma wholeheartedly.

May virtue and excellence abound. This is the blessed speech of the Lord of Refuge, Shabkar.
