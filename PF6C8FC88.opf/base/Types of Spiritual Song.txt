Types of Spiritual Song

by Khenpo Shenga

In general, there are many types of spiritual song (mgur dbyangs). There are the songs of the
spontaneously arisen herukas, which delight the vīras and ḍākinīs. There are dohas of the
adepts, which directly reveal the wisdom of realization. There are songs of calling the
guru from afar, which invoke the guru's wisdom mind once devotion and compassion have arisen
without effort. There are the experiential songs of yogis, which freely express whatever
arises in deeper experience. There are joyous songs of realization, which emerge when the
creative power of experience and realization develops. There are songs of prevailing over
appearance, which derive from a feeling of total fearlessness. There are songs of spacious
ease and contentment, which are based on the completion of virtuous activity and the absence
of regret. There are contrived songs, which are combined with ideas and feelings. There
are songs that express the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, which are based on a realization
of universal equality. And there are many other types besides these.

Of these, your songs are a good example of yogic songs of experience, and in this I rejoice.

May virtue abound!
