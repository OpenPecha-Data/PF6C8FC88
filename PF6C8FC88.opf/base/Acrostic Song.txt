An Acrostic Song

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ahoy, yogins and yoginīs!Be not indifferent but practise Dharma!Care for yourselves, my friends
of leisure.Do not conduct yourselves as I do:Eschew clamour and distraction.Fashion yourselves
however you wish.Give up craving for tea, alcohol and food.Have no wish to wander
about like the oblivious.Integrate the Tathāgata’s teachings,Joining their various elements
as one.Knowing that we’re fortunate to be together now,Let us practice the Dharma continuously.Most
forms of erratic behaviourNecessarily lead others to lose faith.One must not
simply lie about like a cow.Provide maternal loving care for all.Quite as lovely and appealing
as a camara,[1]Remain invulnerable to the heat and cold.Strive for the constancy of the
Ganges as it flows.Take to mountain retreats like a fox to his den.Upon your head as a
hat wear the guru’s visualization—Vivid, never forgotten even for so much as a moment.While
avoiding hectic and trivial activity,eXecute only refined conduct at all times.You must
strive to be as stable as Ramaṇa,[2]Zealous not sporadic throughout your whole life.Pass,
like a deer, through every stage,And reach the end of the ten bhūmis.With a roar of laughter,
“Ha! Hi!”Let us realize the meaning of A, the unborn,And empty the pit of saṃsāra from
its depths.
