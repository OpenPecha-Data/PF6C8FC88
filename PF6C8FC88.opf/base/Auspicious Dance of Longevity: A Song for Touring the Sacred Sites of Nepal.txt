Auspicious Dance of Longevity

A Song for Touring the Sacred Sites of Nepal

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ahoye.With auspicious appearancesAnd virtuous companions,In the heart of NepalI, the yogi, have
arrived.This land of wonder,In prospect sublime.Blessed by the Buddha,Its dharmakāya stūpas,Three
in number reside,Bringing dazzling virtue,Abundant prosperity,And suffusive blessings,All
amassed like clouds,And a rain of compassionCascading in showers.Great gods of
this world,The keepers of wealth,Grant fortune and plenty.Men are all heroes,With faces like
conchesAs ruddy as coral,Noble and handsome.Women are fair,Like daughters of devasTransported
to earth.

Ahoye.Young children all gather,Divine offspring at play.Martial banners of heavenFly as if
toward foes.Terrain shaped by technologyResounds with gentle music.And blessed places of powerFill
the land all around.Peaks like towering crystal,Streams pure in eight ways,[1]Bathing
pools vast in number,Sundry delicious food and drink,Smooth fabrics that flutter and
sway—The sight of such a place as thisTruly brings joy to the mind.

Ahoye.May the virtue of this pilgrimage,Which I now offer to the root guru,Gladden his wise
and noble heart,And through its gift to former-mother beings,May all set out upon freedom's
finest path.

Ahoye.May performing this auspicious dance—once, twice, three times—bring joy and happiness
in abundance.

On the 5th day of the 12th month.[2]
