Piercing Devotion

A Lament for Lama Sakyapa

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti.Guide throughout existence and peace,Crown-ornament of all the learned and accomplished,Omnipresent
sovereign Vajradhara,Great Sakyapa Kunga Nyingpo,Bodhisattva Splendour-of-Generosity,Supremely
noble Avalokiteśvara in person,Most affectionate Lotus-in-Hand,Like
a vast ocean of wisdom,You are none other than Mañjuśrī,Secret treasury of the vajra vehicle,Keeper
of jewelled riches of the profound and vast,Leader of the fortunate to supreme
accomplishment,Keeper of secrets, Vajra-in-Hand,Your single form that multipliesTo benefit
beings simultaneouslyThrough deeds beyond imagining,In wondrous, unnumbered magical manifestations,Emanation
of the bodhisattvas of the three families,Progenitor of all unrivalled
membersOf the flawless family of Khön,Gentle lord, great treasury of compassion,O Sakyapa
guru:I pray to you from the depth of my heart.Always look upon me with compassion,Grant your
blessings of secret body, speech and mind.Lead me and all those connected with meTo the
realm of great bliss.Liberate all beings of saṃsāra’s six realmsFrom the ocean of suffering.Cause
the teachings to spread and holders of the teachings to increase.Obliterate, through
your immense power, those who would harm the teachings,So that not even their names remain.Cause
perfect happiness and joyTo fill the world like the light of the sun and moon.O
protector, grant your blessings, and make it so.
