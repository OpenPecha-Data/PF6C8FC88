Throughout the karmic chain of my lives, you adorn my crown,
dralmé lé mön karpö metok gi chingwé
Tied inseparably with the flowers of pure action and aspiration,

Incomparable and most gracious guru, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel,
tsen gyi jö ka tubten chöpel dé khyen no
Your name so difficult to utter: Thupten Chöpel,1 care for me!

Remain at the centre of the palace of the indestructible chakra in my heart,
dralmé dé sum düdtsi chötrin gyi nyenpé
As I present nectar-like offering-clouds of the three kinds of faith,
rik gyé khyabdak mipam lodrö ni drimé
Lord of a hundred buddha families, Mipham Lodrö Drimé—Stainless Intellect,
zung pob yönten chewé terdzö khyé khyen no
Treasury of myriad qualities of retention and confidence, care for me!

Today, through the guru’s compassion, I am joyful and happy,
samdön damchö dünma yishyin du drup né
My aspiration to practise the noble Dharma has been fulfilled,
gepé lü di gar la khyöl tab shik mé kyang
And even though this aged body lacks the strength to dance,
kyipé lu chung mel né töl jung du guk dö
I feel moved to sing this spontaneous happy song from my bed!

rik druk khorwé né na kyi duk gi lé nang
Karmic experiences of joy and sorrow in saṃsāra’s six realms
kar nak söké trin shyin tak ten shyik mé kyang
Have no more permanence or stability than clouds in spring,
nga chak damchö chöpé kalzang gi kyewo
But those of us with the fortune to practise the noble Dharma
dé né dewar dro chir kyipo ru duk go
Proceed from one joy to the next and thus remain content!

lé mön khu chuk bumö lu yang kyi kül né
Inspired by the cuckoo call of past karma and aspirations,

I entered the garden of Buddhist teachings at an early age,
tek chok düdtsi zekmé chülen la rolwé
And through savouring the nectar drops of the supreme vehicle,
tokmé tendrel dampé chö chok la drik song
Created the right initial conditions to follow the sacred Dharma.

I kept in mind the lives of the great masters of the past,
tsungmé drinchen lama yishyin gyi norbu
And received instructions from the incomparable noble guru,
tön khor nyamga dzompa data yang dren na
Even now when I think of the joyous gatherings of teacher and disciples,
lü sem dö mi tsukpé ga tro shyik dukpa
I feel so elated that my mind is stirred and my body cannot hold still.

kyabné gyatsö chi zuk lama ni jé yi
The lord guru is the embodiment of infinite sources of refuge,
tukjé nabza karpö dru ta la jü né
And holding on to a corner of the white cloth of his compassion,
nam yang dralwa mepé mönlam shyik tab yö
I made the aspiration that we might never be apart.
da ni ji tar ché kyang kyipo ru duk go
Now, no matter what happens, I shall always be happy.

The ultimate practice passed down by the vidyādharas of the lineage
jalü chöku drubpé tek tsé yi chö tsul
Is the Dharma of the highest vehicle, the means to attain the rainbow body dharmakāya—
di dang tré tsé sipa tama ru ngépé
All who encounter it truly discover the rarest of the rare,
lo puk khong la chölwé naljor nga kyipa
And I, a yogi who keeps it forever in mind, am happy indeed!

Lord of all buddha families, Mipham Lodrö Drimé,

I have realized the indestructible genuine nature of awareness and emptiness,
yichö chömé ta gom yi yül né bor song
And let go of mental speculation and contrived views and meditation.

Without depending upon strenuous effort and book learning,
zung dzin sem kyi dü gya nying ü né drolwé
The knots of dualistic mind have been released from deep within my heart,
do ngak shyung gyé né sang tsolmé du sharwé
And the secrets of a hundred sūtra and mantra works effortlessly appear—
tek tsé sang lam nyokpé naljor nga kyipa
As a yogi on the secret path of the pinnacle of vehicles, I am happy indeed!

Motivated by the purest intention of non-referential love and compassion,

To lead all with whom I am connected to the most perfect of pure lands,
shyum mé nying tob tsönpé go cha shyik gö né
I shall wear the armour of unflagging diligence and strength of heart—
shyen dön yishyin drubpé naljor nga kyipa
As a yogi who accomplishes the welfare of others, I am happy indeed!

pendé jungné tubten rinchen gyi tok zang
The crowning jewel of buddha’s teachings, source of all benefit and happiness,
cher nyik tün sum khorlö makrum du nepé
Remains hidden during the dark night of a degenerate age,
shé drup gyaltsen karpö tsemo ru tek né
But having raised it aloft on the white victory banner of study and practice,
tenpé shyap tok drubpé naljor nga kyipa
I, a yogi who renders service to the teachings, am happy indeed!

jungdü gyumé pungpo zakché kyi trulkhor
This tainted contraption, an illusory assemblage of the elements,
barmé na dang gawé dukha yi zin kyang
Is tormented by the incessant duḥkha of sickness and ageing,
daljor mi tsé dön den damchö kyi khyölwé
But with a free and fortunate human life devoted meaningfully to the Dharma,
sem la gu yang kyi kyi nyima shyik shar duk
The sun of happiness dawns freely and expansively in my mind!

da ni tsa sum lha dang lama yi gyé tsé
Now, that the Three Root deities and guru have lovingly accepted me,
uk yung sang tam rolmo nawa ru sön né
And the music of secret instruction has passed into my ears,
dé né dewar drowé ding chen shyik nyé dé
I have gained the vast confidence of proceeding from joy to joy,
chikpur né kyang kyipé nyamlu shyik guk dö
And even in solitude, I feel inspired to sing a song of happiness!

sön kyang ga té tendrö dön chen shyik drup duk
In life, I am joyful because I serve the teachings and beings.
shi yang ga té dakpé shying kham dro ngé
In death, I shall be joyful too, as I shall surely go to a pure land;
kyi duk lé kyi nangwa ji dra shyik jung yang
So whatever karmic experiences arise, whether positive or negative,
yi la ré dang dokpé sem tral dé bor song
I have let go of mental agitation based on hopes and fears!

nam shyik zakché pungpö bub gya lé drol tsé
When the time comes to escape the confines of these tainted aggregates,
wangmé lé kyi kyepé gyu lü di sün né
I shall reject this uncontrollable, illusory body born of karma,
dé den dakpé shying gi mé tok gi nyingpor
And seek instead a supreme form adorned with signs and marks
yi ong tsenpé dzepé lü chok shyik len dö
In the heart of a lotus flower within the pure realm of Sukhāvatī.

sangyé ngö lé tek chok dampa shyik nö né
Having received instruction on the supreme vehicle from an actual buddha,
tokpé lü tob dzok té trulwa yi rol gar
My body of realization will perfect its strength, and its emanation display
rigdzin sempa semmé dza drok dang deb né
Will enjoy the company of vidyādharas and bodhisattvas male and female,
dak dang ma dak shying du temo ru peb dro
While travelling to behold various spectacles in pure and impure realms.

dor na da né tsönpé go cha shyi gö té
In short, I rejoice that by putting on the armour of diligence
kunzang chöpa gyatsö namtar la lab né
And training in the vast, ocean-like activity of Samantabhadra,
ma gen dro kun sipé gyatso lé drol chir
I shall strive for as long as space exists to liberate all beings,
namkha si du tsön la trowa shyik kyé chung
My very own past mothers, from the ocean of existence!

dé tar longchö khorlö rolmo yi yang nyen
When this sweet sound of the music of the constant wheel of enjoyment,
trashi dön kün drubpé gakyi kyi doha
This doha of happiness that brings universal auspiciousness and fulfilment,
di nyi nawar sönpé chok men gyi dro kün
Is heard by any being, regardless of whether they are high or low in status,
taktu nya ngen mepé palyön la mön no
May they gain the excellent fortune of everlasting freedom from sorrow!
Thus, on the morning of the second day of the vaiśākha month in the Earth Hare year of the seventeenth
calendrical cycle (1999), Ngawang Lodrö Tsungmé spoke these words as they arose
spontaneously and set them down without amendment. May virtue abound!
