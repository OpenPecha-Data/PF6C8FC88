When Flowers Were Ravaged by the Frost

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Noble guru, unique embodiment of the Three Jewels,The unfailing sources of refuge,Let your lotus
feet adorn my crown.Turn my mind turn towards the Dharma!

During the bountiful period of the harvest moon,Flowers, originating from the kingdom of Nepal,Appeared
in a rich array of colours,Each as beautiful as an attractive girl,Inspiring a
hundred joys and offering solace and delightTo the eyes and minds of all, wise and foolish
alike—Such a vast profusion of perfect splendour!

Then, in the dark night of the twenty-eighthOf that month of autumn there aroseThe radiant daughter
of a clear silver sky,The bright-faced goddess of the constellations,Who brought the
fresh scent of morning dewAnd at dawn placed hats of whiteUpon the heads of all the flowers,So
that, in the rising sun, they withered.Their leaves and petals all drooped,Their necks
no longer supported their crowns,And they resembled the corpses of the dead.

This example illustrates impermanence:How the glamour of youth is overcomeBy the armies of passing
months and years,And how in the Lord of Death’s expansive darkCountless yamas of deluded
perception appearAs a frost that ravages the flowers of cherished bodies,Makes their
heads droop, their lower lips sag,And their limbs turn rigid and hard as wood.

There is no doubt that such severe horrorsWill swiftly come to pass.And as this is more than
my heart could bear,I must apply myself to the Dharma right away,Or else be left without
recourse.

Now, therefore, while I have the freedom,Let me not succumb to laziness or indolence.And, as
I set the great fires of diligence ablaze,Inspire me with your blessings,So that I may burn
the thicket of the afflictionsAnd swiftly escape the fiery pitOf saṃsāra, so difficult
to traverse.You, my noble father-guru, care for me!

When an array of flowers was ravaged by the frost, I wrote this sorrowful song by reflecting
upon impermanence.
