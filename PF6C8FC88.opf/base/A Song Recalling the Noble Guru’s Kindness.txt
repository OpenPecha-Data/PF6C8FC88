A Song Recalling the Noble Guru’s Kindness

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Lord Vajradhara, embodiment of all the buddhas,Glorious Orgyen Chökyi Gyatso,[1]Remain as an
adornment upon this mendicant’s crown.

No matter what befalls this heir of yours,
He will always pray to you, the guru.

To have attained this support of a human form with its freedoms and advantagesAnd entered the
teachings of the noble SageIs your kindness, my precious father guru.

To have heard such splendours,From when I first learnt the alphabetThrough to when I studied
the Secret Essence tantra,Is your kindness, my only refuge, father guru.[2]

That the ground of basic renunciation and individual liberationIs not spoiled by the swamp of
involvement with young maidens,And that this child is not now surrounded by illegitimate
offspringIs due to your kindness, protector guru, lord of sages.

That my mind set upon awakening, the very essence of Dharma,Has not been wounded by the axe
of forsaking sentient beings,And that I still maintain a paltry wish to benefit othersIs due
to your kindness, noble protector of beings.

That I can practise whatever I wishFrom the ocean of profound instructions of kama and terma
teachingsAnd that I might thereby attain accomplishment and liberation in this lifetimeIs
also due to your kindness, O Vajradhara.

That I have an inclination towards positive actions,Such as commissioning sacred objects and
making offerings,And that my faith and unbiased pure perceptionContinue to expand unbound
by time and distance is due to your kindness.[3]

In short, any partial qualities that I now possessOr have acquired at any time in the pastAre
all due to your kindness, precious father.Until this son attains awakening through your
kindness,If I delight you through my offerings of body, speech and mind,Sovereign gracious
lord, inspire me with your blessings!
