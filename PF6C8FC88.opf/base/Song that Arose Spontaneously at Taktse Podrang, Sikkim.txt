Song that Arose Spontaneously at Taktse Podrang, Sikkim

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ahoye!From the expanse of the unarisen ground,The path is unobstructed—if you travel itYou will
attain the fruition that is unarisen.

Descendents of the crazy Lhatsün,On the plain of ālaya inactivityIs the stallion of naturally
cognizant awareness.By riding this steed with its limbs of wisdom,You'll cross the plains
of existence and peaceAnd travel to the vast kingdom of dharmakāya,Wherein to view the spectacle.


On the 29th day of the later ninth month, this came to mind spontaneously at the Taktse Podrang
in Sikkim.[1]
