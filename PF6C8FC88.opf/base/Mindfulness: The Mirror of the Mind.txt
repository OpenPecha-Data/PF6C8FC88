Mindfulness: The Mirror of the Mind

by Nyoshul Khenpo Jamyang Dorje

Homage to naturally arising, king-like mindfulness!

I am the mirror of mindfulness,Clearly revealing carefulness and mindfulness.Look, my vajra
friends!Seeing me, mindfulness is supported.

Pray now to the Three Jewels,
Inseparable from the Lama-Guru!

Undistractedly, look into the essence of mind!

Mindfulness is the root of the Dharma,Mindfulness is the path’s main practice,Mindfulness is
a fortress for the mind,Mindfulness is an aid to the wisdom of self-knowing rigpa,Mindfulness
is a support for Mahāmudrā, Dzogchen and Madhyamaka.

Lacking mindfulness, we’re overcome by negative forces.Lacking mindfulness, we’re beset by laziness.Lacking
mindfulness, we commit every wrong.Lacking mindfulness, we fail to accomplish
our aims.

Mindlessness—it’s like a pile of shit!Mindlessness—it’s like fishing on dry land!Mindlessness—it’s
like a heartless corpse!

Make your mindfulness secure, my friends!

Through the heartfelt intentions of the precious teachers,May we come now to recognize our own
true mindfulness!

This request, a spur to remember mindfulness,Was offered to friends who possess the eyes of
DharmaBy the terrible monk called Jamyang Dorje,Who is really just a buck-toothed ox.

Sarva mangalam!
