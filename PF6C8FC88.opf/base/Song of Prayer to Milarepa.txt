Song of Prayer to Milarepa

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ocean of Kagyü siddhas, know me, care for me!On Kailash, king of snow-capped mountains,Resides
the foremost of yogins, Lord Milarepa,Whose name dispels the misery of the lower realms.


Father, supreme focus of recollection, Töpa Ga,Kindly watch over me, evildoer that I am.Guard
me from the abyss of saṃsāra’s lower realms.Take me, your child, in your arms of compassion.And
prevent me from slipping into harmful deeds!

I have heard the profound Dharma, sūtra and mantra,But have failed to put it into practice in
the proper wayAnd my character remains impervious, like a stone in water.

As I deceive others through my pretentious acts,While the five poisonous afflictions blaze within,I’ll
find no freedom but be anchored to the hells.

Failing to guard vows and commitments, I stray into faultsAnd snatch any unmerited offerings
that come my way.

While understanding the nature of right and wrong,I’ve fallen under the influence of unwholesome
misdeeds.

Although I meditate on the generation and completion phases,I am constrained by ordinary perceptions
and states of mind.

My devotion for the noble gurus is only meagre,My mumbled prayers nothing more than empty words.


Failing to recall the kindness of all mother sentient beings,I have surrendered my love, compassion
and bodhicitta.

I conceal the demon of self-cherishing within myself,And nurture the bad attitude of seeking
my own happiness.

I have no pure perception of other dharma practitioners,And am plagued by the evil spirit of
cynicism and envy.

Lord Shepa Dorje, protect wretched Lodrö,I implore you.And turn his mind towards the noble Dharma.


Sung in sadness on the seventeenth day of the month.[1]
