How to Take the Practice to Heart

by Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen

Namo ratna gurave!

With the fortune of having acquired freedom and advantage,With the trust that comes from fear
of birth and death,With the devotion of assiduously following instructions,Child of bright
intelligence, keep the following in mind!

To take the practice to heart,Please exercise great determination,Forgo attachment, dwell in
the mountains,And forsake this life’s concerns.

To develop qualities within your being,Please keep the threefold vows and commitments pure,Minimize
arrogance and conceit,And show the utmost respect to all.

To receive the blessings of the foremost one,Please conceive of him as an actual buddha,[1]Take
his life of liberation as your model,And devote yourself to constant prayer.

Please avoid conceptualizing the view,Determine that appearances are mind,Neither reject saṃsāra
nor pursue nirvāṇa,And let the agent be purified in basic space.

Please avoid becoming fixated in meditation,Do away with attachment to bliss and clarity,Capture
the natural state wherein the root is cut,And go beyond expression and thought.

Please avoid the conduct of adoption and avoidance,Allow dualistic conceptions to dissolve by
themselves,Regard the eight preoccupations as equal,And eschew the ‘remedies’ of positive
thoughts.

Please do not hope for fruition at some time hereafter,But let realization manifest,Merge meditation
with post-meditation,And let the compulsion to practice fade.

To bring about the welfare of other beings,Please let the force of aspiration run its course,And
the interdependence of causes and conditions arise,As you master great, non-referential
compassion.

This short song of eightfold requestWas sung for one of bright intelligence.Ensure in this way
that it proves significant.Persevere in meditation until it does.

Samāptam iti.[2]
