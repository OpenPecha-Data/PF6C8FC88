The Excellent Path of Definitive Meaning

An Unmistaken Expression of the Definitive Mahāmudrā

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Omnipresent Vajradhara, Tilopa,Nāro, Maitrī, Marpa, Mila, Dakpo and the rest—Countless Kagyü
adepts, look on me with compassion.

What I call my own mind is this flickering awareness,Intermittently thinking of everything under
the sun.Its apparent reality, when it is left unexamined, is what binds.Caught up in
hopes and fears, I am exhausted by existenceWith all its dualistic thinking, deluded ideas
and acceptance and rejection.When, through the kindness of the guru, I do apply analysis,I
see that mind is entirely empty of origination, presence and departure.Without basis or
origin, mind itself is great emptiness.It is the natural state of all things in saṃsāra and
nirvāṇa.It is the limitless dharmadhātu, vast and expansive.Awareness and unawareness are
what we label ‘saṃsāra’ and ‘nirvāṇa’.With realization, we’re buddhas; in its absence, we’re
ordinary beings.In fact, neither saṃsāra nor nirvāṇa is real.The names for this include
dharmadhātu, sugata-essence,Vajra-of-mind, and emptiness complete with all supreme aspects.There
are many names, but all refer to the same thing.

As for the stages of the path to realizing this,They include maturing one’s being, training
the mind, gathering the accumulations,Purifying obscurations, and devotion—through the application
of these key pointsWe can receive the guru’s blessings, and then through symbolic
means,Or without any teaching and without meditating, in an instant,The guru and disciple
merge as one within the dharmatā,So that awareness is suddenly clear in inexpressible Mahāmudrā.Untainted
by ordinary consciousness, this is the union of clarity and emptiness.It
is experienced as perpetual, timeless, beyond the three times.Without grasping or effort and
not slipping into distraction,We avoid the trap of mental constructs or any wish to meditate.Sensory
impressions and thoughts are self-liberating; they vanish by themselves.From
the very moment of their arising they are on the way to being liberated.And stillness, movement
and awareness are understood to be great equality.Any thought that occurs dawns as
the display of dharmakāya,And we gain boundless qualities of knowledge, love and power.When
energy-mind and experience merge inseparably,We have reached the limit of the path Mahāmudrā.


With fruitional Mahāmudrā, body and mind are unobstructed;All-pervasive like space, they possess
the seven aspects of union,[1]A treasury of the oceanic qualities of the kāyas and wisdoms,And
we attain the state of the glorious and mighty Vajradhara.
