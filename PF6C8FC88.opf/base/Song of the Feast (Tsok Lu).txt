Song of the Feast (Tsok Lu)
by Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa

lé mön tendrel paksam jönshing gi tengdu
On top of a wish-fulfilling tree, the auspicious coincidence of karma and aspiration,
gyagar shar gyi maja shyönnu yang peb jung
The youthful peacock of eastern India has arrived.
majé duk kor dampé chö chok la gyur dang
When the display of the peacock becomes holy Dharma,
shyönpa ngatsö tarpé lam na shyik zin yong
We youthful ones are set onto the path of liberation.

sönam chi kyi gyalmö shingta la pebpé
On the chariot of the meritorious queen of spring,
lho mön shinglö tsal gyi khujuk gi sung nyen
From the tree-groves of Mon in the south has come the cuckoo-bird with its sweet song,
yagi drizé bumö lingbu lé nyenpa
Sweeter than the music of the flutes of the daughters of the gandharva above.
yar sum namda sowé tendrel la yak jung
How good the excellent coincidence of the flourishing three months of summer!

dir dü lé mön tünpé dorje dang pündrok
Gathered here are the vajra brothers and sisters whose karma and aspirations are in accord.
ngatsö lama shyukpé chöra la peb dang
Please come to this Dharma assembly where our guru dwells.
mindrol dütsi tungwé gatön gyi ngang né
At this festival we drink the amṛta that ripens and frees,
nyamga lu ru lenpé khyechö shik yö do
And from that comes the special Dharma of singing the songs of joyful experience.

dechen pogyur mepé shyuk dral gyi ü né
Among these rows of unchanging great bliss,
lha dang lamé shyalré ma gom kyang tong jung
Even when not meditating, we witness the faces of the deity and the guru.
ma dang khandrö nyingtik ösal gyi tekpé
By means of the yāna of luminosity, the heart-essence of the mother and ḍākinīs,
jalü chökur drubpé ngödrub chik shyu o
Please grant attainment—the rainbow body, the dharmakāya!
