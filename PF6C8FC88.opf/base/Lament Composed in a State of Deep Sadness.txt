Lament Composed in a State of Deep Sadness

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Father guru, Vajradhara Loter Wangpo, care for me.Look upon me, the evil one, right now with
compassion.This son of yours is contaminated with delusion and negative thoughts,And cannot
meet you in your wisdom form.He cannot even so much as look upon your face,O protector,
in his dreams.Lord, my deep faith and devotion for youIs sincere and from the heart.

Still, although this is not mere lip service but deeply felt,Lord, you do not show your face
and I cannot hear your voice,As if my mind were devoid of deep devotion.

I have had many human gurus,But five were greatest in their kindness.[1]Of these the sole adornment
on my crownIs none other than you, my father guru.

When I recall your life of liberation, O lord,I cannot but succumb to tears.When I utter your
name faith overwhelms me.Considering this, look upon me with compassion.Do not abandon this
pupil of yours to his evil karma.Any transgressions of the samayas of the lord’s three
secretsI continually confess with heartfelt remorse.Grant me the gift of perfect purity,
I pray.

Continuously, I visualise you at the centre of my heartAnd offer single-pointed prayers.Inspire
me with your blessings.Induce the great power of experience and realization, I pray.As
the fourfold maṇḍala support dissolves in four stages,May I attain mastery of the glorious
kāyas.Noble father, mighty Vajradhara, care for me.Bless me so that I never part from you,
my lord.

Thus, on the twenty-eight day of the twelfth month of the Earth Mouse year,[2] I wrote this
lament while in a state of deep sadness.
