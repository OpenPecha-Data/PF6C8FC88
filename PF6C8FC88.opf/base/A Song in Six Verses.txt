A Song in Six Verses

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Ah Eh!All-knowing perfect buddha,Remain forever inseparablyIn your place upon my crown.

Transmit the blessings of the direct transmission,Confer the empowerment of the force of awareness,Bring
me to the state at which delusion is exhausted,Cause my perception to unfold
without aim or focus.

All dharmas of appearance and existence are illusoryAnd lack true nature or reality;All dharmas
have been pure from the very beginning.

Great self-knowing awareness beyond the mind,A state free from deliberate activity or exertion,Magnificent
luminosity and equalness—In this expanse of the all-encompassing sphereThere
is great, spontaneous perfection—Aho!

Seeing does not come about through looking,But great settling, spontaneous and uncontrived,In
the womb that is threefold leaving-as-is,Where the three kāyas are naturally present,Without
rejection or adoption, removal or addition.

By seeing this through the guru’s kindness,May all sentient beings of the three realmsAttain
complete and perfect awakeningWithin the youthful vase body of their own awareness.
